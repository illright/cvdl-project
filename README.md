# CVDL Project: Shape correction

This project was created by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

## Developing

Use `pnpm install` to install the dependencies first, and then start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

This project uses the [static-adapter](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-static) to build a static website that is easily deployable on any server.
To build the website, use:

```bash
pnpm run build
```
The build output can then be found in the `build` directory.

> You can preview the built app with `pnpm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
